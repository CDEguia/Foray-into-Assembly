# Foray-into-Assembly
## CMPS 337
Using inline Assembly code.

This is a Visual Studio C++ project using inline _asm{} code to demonstrate the **Assembler Language** in a Windows enviroment.

When compiled, or run [Assembly.exe](https://github.com/CDEguia/Foray-into-Assembly/blob/master/Assembling/Release/Assembling.exe?raw=true), the user will be given a menu in Command Prompt / Terminal window. Each item in the menu will demonstrate a different aspect of the **Assembler Language**. Many of the menu items will rely on previously demonstrated code and introduce a new aspect of the **Assembler Language**.
